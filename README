Usage:
================================================================================
> go run hao_dining.go 


================================================================================
Algorithm/Procedure: 
================================================================================
Then input the number of philosophers you want, but it should be an integer larger than 1, e.g., 10

The methodology is similar to "Resource hierachy solution" at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem 
Philosophers have their own id and the maximum id (maxid), which is the number of philosophers in the table. 
1) The philosophers with id smaller than maxid always pick his/her left fork. Then check the right fork. 
       If the right fork is not available, the left fork will be returned and continue to think (another round). 
       Otherwise, the right fork will be picked and this philosopher will start to eat. After eating, the forks will be returened and continue to another round.  
2) The philosophers with maxid always pick his/her right fork. Then check the left fork. Other procedure is almost the same.
